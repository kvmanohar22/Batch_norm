<h2>Effect of batch normalization on deep neural networks using tensorflow</h2>

<p>Taking help from <a href="http://r2rt.com/implementing-batch-normalization-in-tensorflow.html">here</a> implemented the model on mnist dataset</p>

<code>plots/histograms/*</code> contains histograms of tensors fed to the activation function of second layer of the network

<code>accuracy_comparison.png</code> compares how accuracy varies with and without batch normalization
